          engaging web applications. With a strong foundation in both front-end
          and back-end development, I am skilled in a variety of languages and
          frameworks including CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, React and Node js.
        </p>

          In my previous work experiences, I have successfully developed and
          maintained a number of web projects for both small businesses and
          large corporations. I am always seeking new challenges and
          opportunities to grow and improve my skills as a developer.
